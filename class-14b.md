# What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team
## Like most 25-year-olds, Julia Rozovsky wasn’t sure what she wanted to do with her life. She had worked at a consulting firm, but it wasn’t a good match. Then she became a researcher for two professors at Harvard, which was interesting but lonely.

## So in 2009, she chose the path that allowed her to put off making a decision: She applied to business schools and was accepted by the Yale School of Management.

## When Rozovsky arrived on campus, she was assigned to a study group carefully engineered by the school to foster tight bonds.
## They had gone to similar colleges and had worked at analogous firms. These shared experiences, Rozovsky hoped, would make it easy for them to work well together. 
## Rozovsky’s study group was a source of stress. ‘‘I always felt like I had to prove myself,
## When the group met, teammates sometimes jockeyed for the leadership position or criticized one another’s ideas. There were conflicts over who was in charge and who got to represent the group in class
## So Rozovsky started looking for other groups she could join
## she found groub to do The competitions were voluntary, but the work wasn’t all that different from what Rozovsky did with her study group but The members of her case-competition team had a variety of professional experiences 
## Despite their disparate backgrounds, however, everyone clicked. They emailed one another dumb jokes and usually spent the first 10 minutes of each meeting chatting. When it came time to brainstorm, ‘‘we had lots of crazy ideas and they felt like they could say anything to each other and the won lots of  competitions because of that 
## It always struck Rozovsky as odd that her experiences with the two groups were dissimilar. Each was composed of people who were bright and outgoing. When she talked one on one with members of her study group, the exchanges were friendly and warm. It was only when they gathered as a team that things became fraught. By contrast, her case-competition team was always fun and easygoing. In some ways, the team’s members got along better as a group than as individual friends.
## n late 2014, Rozovsky and her fellow Project Aristotle number-crunchers began sharing their findings with select groups of Google’s 51,000 employees. By then, they had been collecting surveys, conducting interviews and analyzing statistics for almost three years.
## after Rozovsky gave one presentation he met Sakaguchi this man didn’t study computers in college. Everyone who works for him is much smarter than him.’’ But he is talented at managing technical workers, and as a result.
## Sakaguchi had recently become the manager of a new team, and he wanted to make sure things went better this time and from his experince he found I, until the off-site, I had separated things in my head into work life and life life,’’ Laurent told me. ‘‘But the thing is, my work is my life. I spend the majority of my time working. Most of my friends I know through work. If I can’t be open and honest at work, then I’m not really living, am I?’’
## What Project Aristotle has taught people within Google is that no one wants to put on a ‘‘work face’’ when they get to the office. No one wants to leave part of their personality and inner life at home. But to be fully present at work, to feel ‘‘psychologically safe,’’ we must know that we can be free enough, sometimes, to share the things that scare us without fear of recriminations. We must be able to talk about what is messy or sad, to have hard conversations with colleagues who are driving us crazy. We can’t be focused just on efficiency. Rather, when we start the morning by collaborating with a team of engineers and then send emails to our marketing colleagues and then jump on a conference call, we want to know that those people really hear us. We want to know that work is more than just labor.
## Google’s research into teamwork: By adopting the data-driven approach of Silicon Valley, Project Aristotle has encouraged emotional conversations and discussions of norms among people who might otherwise be uncomfortable talking about how they feel. ‘‘Googlers love data,’’ Sakaguchi told me. But it’s not only Google that loves numbers, or Silicon Valley that shies away from emotional conversations. Most work­places do. ‘‘By putting things like empathy and sensitivity into charts and data reports, it makes them easier to talk about,’’ Sakaguchi told me. ‘‘It’s easier to talk about our feelings when we can point to a number.’’

- From these experiences, we find to form a successful team that does not depend on their academic backgrounds, their experiences, or even our individual relationship with each one of them. The most important is the team spirit.
- In the team, it is not necessary to compete for leadership and to highlight the important self. Results. This happens through cooperation and not shyness in exchanging ideas
- Personal life should never be separated from work we spend the majority of our time working. Most of our friends we know through work. If I can’t be open and honest at work, then I’m not really living, am I
