# What is object-oriented programming?

Object-oriented programming combines a group of data attributes with functions or methods into a unit called an object.


# class
A class is a group of objects which have common properties. It is a template or blueprint from which objects are created. It is a logical entity. It can't be physical.

A class in Java can contain:

- Fields
- Methods
- Constructors
- Blocks
- Nested class and interface



What is Inheritance?
Inheritance is a mechanism in which one class acquires the property of another class so that give us more controll

What Is an Interface?
how we presntaion our class .

## we use the Inheritance to have the common /main  methods as acopy and add what we need else .




Binary, Decimal and Hexadecimal Numbers
# decimal point helps us to know which position is which:

# Bases we have base number afte that we will repate and put the first and other toghther 

from that Counting with Different Number Systems as this rule
Count up until just before the "Base Number", then start at 0 again, but first you add 1 to the number on your left.

Binary Numbers
base 2 begin from 0 and 1 after that we repate as we said put the new num at left

Hexadecimal Numbers
base 16 begin from 0 and f after that we repate as we said put the new num at left
example : 1F
