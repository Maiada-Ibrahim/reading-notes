# Language Basics
- ## Variables
1. Instance Variables (Non-Static Fields) creat object to call method
2. Class Variables (Static Fields) it can take aplace in momery so can the code run with out create object 
3. Local Variables
4. Parameters

- ## Operators

|Operator| Precedence|
| --------- |------------ |
postfix|	expr++ expr--|
|unary	|++expr --expr +expr -expr ~ !
|multiplicative|	* / %
|additive	|+ -
|shift|	<< >> >>>
|relational|	< > <= >= instanceof
|equality	|== !=
|bitwise AND|	&
|bitwise exclusive OR|	^
|bitwise inclusive OR	|
|logical AND|	\&&
|logical OR|	\| \|
|ternary	|? :
|assignment	|= += -= *= /= %= &= ^= |= <<= >>= >>>=

 equal at object its diffirent it if take same vale and use == it will false we must use equal
----------------------------

-  ## Expressions, Statements, and Blocks
block is a set of statements and and the statment bulid buy expressions

## Reddit thread on compiling
###  What does it mean to compile code?
 I need to convert the high level  language such as java to machine language(byte language) that happens by using complier the result frome comiling it is compile code after that we need to run environment to run code and because the java is conseder as back end the browser cant run the code so we use the component to run we using a tool its name JKD this tool contain compiler and MVC   Model-View-Controller Pattern this pattern is used to separate application's concerns and run it

## Compiling

the compiler take the code and convert it to can work agin


## Java’s API Documentation
Nowadays, things are a bit different. Java has a whole collection of grammatical features, but Java is much more than just a big set of grammar rules. Java has a standard Application Programming Interface —a huge library consisting of over 4,000 classes, each with its own functionality, its own limitations, and its own rules for effective use.


### Searching for a term
You can find things in the API documentation in a number of different ways. Each way is convenient in one situation or another. For example, Java has a method named System.out.println. What follows describes two ways to look up the System.out.println method.
- Using the index
1. Visit docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/.
2. Click the INDEX link at the top of the page to open the index
3. In the P section, do a search for println to find the println entries.
4. Pick one of the println entries.
5. Click the link for the entry that you’ve chosen.
