## Creating a useful GraphQL server using AWS Amplify
![](https://www.qsstechnosoft.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/RelayReducers.png)
- AWS Amplify brings together multiple AWS services in a powerful tool that generates the backend infrastructure, communication and authentication between AWS services.


- @connection directive enables you to specify relationships between @model types

The tool can allow you to write a GraphQL schema, have the backend resolvers and database generated automatically, plus host everything on AWS, and a lot more so we need AWS account

## Set up AWS Amplify
- First, follow the [first page of this guide](https://docs.amplify.aws/cli/start/install/#pre-requisites-for-installation) to set up AWS Amplify CLI.

- add Amplify features to the project
- Open the folder you want to contain your project in your terminal, and run the command amplify init This will ask you some basic questions about your app, but itâ€™s good to keep things as default for now

## Create a basic GraphQL API
  you have to use a custom Amplify GraphQL directive called @connection. This creates a link between two fields, and can be implemented per the following:

       type Topic @model {
     id: ID!
     title: String!
      description: String
      comments: [Comment] @connection(keyName: "TopicComments")
      tags: [Tag]
     }

    type Tag @model {
     id: ID!
          tag: String
    topics: [Topic]
     }

      type Comment @model {
         id: ID!
         text: String
     topic: Topic @connection(keyName: "TopicComments")
      }






- If you save your updated schema and refresh GraphiQL, you will notice in the documentation for the createCommment mutation that there is a new field on the input for this type

       mutation {
      createComment(input: {
       text: "Yeah, let's look into Amplify.",
      commentTopicId: "9500834d-186e-41ae-9ac5-ccef4b838afb"
       }) {
       id
       text
       }
        }

one-to-one connection

      type Project @model {
       id: ID!
     name: String
       team: Team @connection
    }

     type Team @model {
     id: ID!
     name: String!
     }


-  one-to-many connection

        type Post @model {
        id: ID!
        title: String!
        comments: [Comment] @connection(keyName: "byPost", fields: ["id"])
       }

       type Comment @model
         @key(name: "byPost", fields: ["postID", "content"]) {
         id: ID!
         postID: ID!
         content: String!
         }
- Many-to-many connections
we can implement many to many using two 1-M @connections, an @key, and a joining @model.
