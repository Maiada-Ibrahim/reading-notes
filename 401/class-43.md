##  Ethics in the workplace

- The more software continues to take over every aspect of our lives, the more important it will be for us to take a stand and ensure that our ethics are ever-present in our code.
-The developers must master their craft and advance their careers. 

- The AI principles represent a reversal for Google, which initially defended its involvement in Project Maven by noting that the project relied on open-source software that was not being used for explicitly offensive purposes. A Google spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the new ethical guidelines.
so we must use the open source in correct way




## Ethics in Technology
### Cyber-Security of self driving cars:

- Could cybercriminals remotely hijack an autonomous car's electronics with the intent to cause a crash? Could terrorists commandeer the vehicles as weapons? Could data stored onboard be unlocked?"

- I am not sure the security problem can solely be solved by regulation. The government, in my opinion, needs to be involved, but it is incredibly difficult to test an existing complex system and certify that it is secure. Rather, I think the government could check if car manufacturers are adhering to some predefined secure coding practices while ensuring they have taken some basic security precautions.
