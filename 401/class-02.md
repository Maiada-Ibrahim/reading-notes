# Arrays, Loops, Imports

A java package is a group of similar types of classes, interfaces and sub-packages.

Package in java can be categorized in two form, built-in package and user-defined package.

There are many built-in packages such as java, lang, awt, javax, swing, net, io, util, sql 

so the first  line in java must be package declaration we have three type of the package declaration 
1. Package statment (i dont understand it)
2. Imports 
3. Class or interface definitions
the first and secand way optional to use but third it must

## Imports 
I will take about import package of class 
we can Importing  diff way
- Importing all the classes   : import packageName.*;
- Importing specific class :import packageName.*;  or without import word 

If you forgot to write import statements there is some thing called NetBeans this will do using right click on the source file and choose Fix Imports or alt+enter (I try this)
