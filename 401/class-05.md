 # linked lists
 
 In the world of software, the ways that we choose to organize our information is half the battle so what is linked lists?

 ## linked list
 A Linked List is a sequence of Nodes that are connected/linked to each other. The most defining feature of a Linked List is that each Node references the next Node in the link.

 ## type of linked lists
 - liner or non-liner :is a sequence and an order to how they are constructed and traversed we liner mean in order to get the eng non liner the the opposite
 -  Singly and Doubly
 Singly: here is only one reference, and the reference points to the Next node in a linked list.

    Doubly: wo (double) references within the node. A Doubly linked list means that there is a reference to both the Next and Previous node.

    we can create includes creating Current at the Head to guarantee we are starting from the beginning. (that Head is always the first node in a Linked List) the Big  O for it The Big O of time for Includes would be O(n) and the big O The Big O of space for Includes would be O(1)
    
    ## we can adding node to the list in diff way 
    # the location of adding is diff and Relies at Big O

    ## Memory management

    for linked list  a dynamic data structure can shrink and grow in memory. It doesnâ€™t need a set amount of memory to be allocated in order to exist, and its size and shape can change, and the amount of memory it needs can change as well.

# the Big O
Is a way to express the amount of time that a function, action, or algorithm takes to run based on how many elements we pass to that function.

we use this to4 Key Areas for analysis:
Input Size
Units of Measurement
Orders of Growth
Best Case, Worst Case, and Average Case

 I didnt under stand Big O for space it what space it take or is the space change I am Confused
