# JavaScript
## What is JavaScript?
### JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with first-class functions. While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles.
## A high-level definition
### JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages — every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. — you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved. It is the third layer of the layer cake of standard web technologies, two of which (HTML and CSS) we have covered in much more detail in other parts of the Learning Area.

## What is JavaScript doing on your page?
### Here we'll actually start looking at some code, and while doing so, explore what actually happens when you run some JavaScript in your page.

### Let's briefly recap the story of what happens when you load a web page in a browser (first talked about in our How CSS works article). When you load a web page in your browser, you are running your code (the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) inside an execution environment (the browser tab). This is like a factory that takes in raw materials (the code) and outputs a product (the web page).

### A very common use of JavaScript is to dynamically modify HTML and CSS to update a user interface, via the Document Object Model API (as mentioned above). Note that the code in your web documents is generally loaded and executed in the order it appears on the page. If the JavaScript loads and tries to run before the HTML and CSS it is affecting has been loaded, errors can occur. You will learn ways around this later in the article, in the Script loading strategies section.
## How do you add JavaScript to your page?
- Internal JavaScript
- External JavaScript
- Inline JavaScript handlers
## JavaScript building blocks
1. Looping code
2. Functions — reusable blocks of code
3. Build your own function
4. Function return values
5. Introduction to events
## What we need to know to use JavaScript ?
1. comments 
2. Datatypes 
###### String -> text -> "Israa" or 'Israa' or "5"
###### Number -> any number 1 5 9 -1 
###### Boolean -> true or false
3. Variables
var userName;
###### userName = "Israa";
###### var myId = 1234;
###### var test = true;
