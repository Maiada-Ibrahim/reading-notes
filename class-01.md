## How People Access the Web
#### Before we look at the code used to build websites it is important to consider the different ways in which people access the web and clarify some terminology.
- ** Browsers** : People access websites using software called a web browser.Popular examples include Firefox.

- ** Web Servers** : When you ask your browser for a web page, the request is sent across the Internet to a special
computer known as a web server which hosts the website.Web servers are special computers that are constantly connected to the Internet, and are optimized to send web pages out to people who request them. Some big companies run their own web servers, but it is more common to use the services of a web hosting company who charge a fee to host your site.

- **Devices : ** People are accessing websites
on an increasing range of devices
including desktop computers,
laptops.
- ** Screen readers : ** Screen readers are programs that read out the contents of acomputer screen to a user. They are commonly used by people with visual impairments.
## How Websites Are Created 
#### All websites use HTML and CSS, but content management systems, blogging software, and e-commerce platforms often add a few more technologies into the mix.
