# Mastering Markdown
## What is Markdown?
###  Markdown is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like # or *.
### You can use Markdown most places around GitHub:
1. [GIFT](https://gist.github.com/)
2. Comments in Issues and Pull Requests
3. Files with the .md or .markdown extension
## Syntax guide
- **Headers**  use #
- **Lists**    use - or 1. 2.
- **Images** use{  ![]()       }
- **Links** use {    []()     }
- **Emphasis**
### You can indicate emphasis with bold, italic, or strikethrough text in comment fields and .md files.
