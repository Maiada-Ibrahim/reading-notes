## What is CSS?
### CSS(Cascading Style Sheets) allows you to create great-looking web pages
## What is CSS for?
### A document is usually a text file structured using a markup language — HTML is the most common markup language, but you may also come across other markup languages such as SVG or XML.

### Presenting a document to a user means converting it into a form usable by your audience. Browsers, like Firefox, Chrome, or Edge , are designed to present documents visually, for example, on a computer screen, projector or printer.
## CSS Specifications
### All web standards technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc.) are defined in giant documents called specifications (or "specs"), which are published by standards organizations (such as the W3C, WHATWG, ECMA, or Khronos) and define precisely how those technologies are supposed to behave.

### CSS is no different — it is developed by a group within the W3C called the CSS Working Group. This group is made of representatives of browser vendors and other companies who have an interest in CSS. There are also other people, known as invited experts, who act as independent voices; they are not linked to a member organization.

### New CSS features are developed, or specified, by the CSS Working Group. Sometimes because a particular browser is interested in having some capability, other times because web designers and developers are asking for a feature, and sometimes because the Working Group itself has identified a requirement. CSS is constantly developing, with new features coming available. However, a key thing about CSS is that everyone works very hard to never change things in a way that would break old websites. A website built in 2000, using the limited CSS available then, should still be usable in a browser today!
## How To Add CSS
### Three Ways to Insert CSS
- External CSS
- Internal CSS
- Inline CSS
## Example
### External styles are defined within the <link> element, inside the <head> section of an HTML page:

      <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="mystyle.css">
    </head>
    <body>

    <h1>This is a heading</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>

     </body>
     </html>
