Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:
|SQL|	NoSQL|
|----------------|-------------|
|called as Relational Databases (RDBMS)|called as non-relational or distributed database|
|have predefined schema| have dynamic schema for unstructured data|
|vertically scalable|horizontally scalable|
| ( structured query language ) for defining and manipulating the data|queries are focused on collection of documents|
 	 
 	 
 	 
 	 



## What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?
## Give a real world example.
Sharding: MySQL sharding os useful when there is large no of write operations in a high traffic website. By sharding MySQL servers, the application is partitioned into multiple servers dividing the database into small chunks. As low cost servers can be deployed for this purpose, this is cost effective.

## What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?
## Give a real world example.
Mongodb is one of the most popular document based NoSQL database as it stores data in JSON like documents
Dynamic Schema: Its gives you the flexibility to evolve your data schema without modifying the existing data

## Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?
MySQL 
## Which type of database is best for scalability?
 MongoDB
