# Project Ideas
# We found an API that renders 3D models for you, we can make a web app that sells online action figures and I can retrieve the data from that API to show a 3D model for the item we want  to show on the site. 
# By using a personal API (server) and a DB, we can bring the needed resources from the 3rd party provider and reshape them then store them, a part of it will render general info to the normal web visitor, and another part will handle the info for visitors who create an account and add some data to their profiles.
